<h2>Fictitious Company: PointR Financial</h2>
<img src="assets/pointr.jpg" alt>
<p>PointR financial is a fictitious investment firm that I created. The task was to create a website that was also a small business. The website required HTML5, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. The overall design of the site was simple yet professional. The design scheme consisted of white, black and blue.

<h2>Instructional Webpage: How to Mead</h2>
<img src="assets/HowtoMead.jpg" alt>
<p> “How to Mead” was an instructional website I made in my first year in the NMPD program. The purpose of the project was to instruct the user on how to do or make something with easily broken down steps using UI and UX design theory, HTML5, CSS and PHP. This was the first major web design project I worked on.
