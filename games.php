<h2>Space Adventures</h2>
<img src="assets/code.jpg" alt>
<p>Space Adventures is a mobile game that utilized the accelerometer built into the phone. The game was made using ActionScript 3 Android Air. You play it by flying around space avoiding the asteroids and collecting crystals to complete the level. The game is currently available for free on the google play store. I was very excited to make this because it was the first mobile app I was developing and the first to be added to the play store.<strong>Check out the game on the Play Store

<h2>Arcade Game</h2>
<img src="assets/game.jpg" alt>
<p>Carrot Rain was a game that I developed at the end of my first year. It is meant to be an arcade game in which the play can move across the screen horizontally in order to dodge the incoming rain of carrots that fall from the top of the screen. The objective of the game is to survive for the specified amount of time.<strong>Download the SWF file <a href="assets/game.swf">Here</a></strong></p>

<h2>Dive or Flop Array</h2>
<img src="assets/dive.jpg" alt>
<p>Dive or Flop is an application I made for one of my open projects. What the application does is, whenever the user clicks the begin button an array will launch causing a specific scene to playout. Either the character will do a nice dive or mess up and do a belly flop. There is a 50/50 chance either will happen and since it is caused by an array the event is random.<strong>Download the SWF file <a href="assets/flashopen.swf">Here</a></strong></p>
